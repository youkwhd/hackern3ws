==========

An alternative front-end for Hacker News.

Dependencies
------------

- CURL
- Memcached (optional)

Configuration
-------------

Every configuration should be tied to the file config.php

Memcached is enabled by default, set MEMCACHED to false to
disable, although it is optional for memcached to be used, know
that it would make the application painfully slow without it.

Powering up server
------------------

I use PHP's built-in server:

    ./serve.sh -h

TODOs
-----

Add `pthread` or `parallel` for better performance.
