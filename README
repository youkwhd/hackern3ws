An alternative front-end for Hacker News.

Powering up server
------------------

I use PHP's built-in server:

    ./serve.sh

NOT FOR PRODUCTION
------------------

Unfortunately, each request is blazingly slow because the server
is required to request each news one by one, thus being
expensive and slow.

One solution to this problem is to pre-build pages but it will
not gonna be efficient since the server has to check if there is
any new news (checking 3 minutes each).

Still, too much of a hassle.
