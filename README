==========

An alternative front-end for Hacker News.

NOT FOR PRODUCTION
------------------

This project is slow because it requires to request for each
news, thus being expensive.

One solution to this problem is to pre-build pages but it will
not gonna be efficient since the server has to check if there is
any new news (checking 3 minutes each).

Still, too much of a hassle.
